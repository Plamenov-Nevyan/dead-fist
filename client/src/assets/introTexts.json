  "The world as you knew it is gone.",
  "In a matter of days, everything crumbled. Cities turned to graveyards, and the streets that once buzzed with life are now filled with the mindless undead, hunting the few survivors who remain. The air is thick with the smell of decay, and the only sound that breaks the silence is the distant groan of a zombie, or worse—the chilling howl of something far more sinister.",
  "No one knows how it started. Some say it was a government experiment gone wrong, others whisper of ancient curses or a plague from the heavens. All you know is that one day the dead stopped staying dead, and survival became a brutal game of wits, skill, and sheer luck.",
  "You are one of the few left standing. Your days are spent scavenging for supplies, dodging the infected, and fighting off not just the undead, but also the desperate and the deranged—those who have lost more than just their humanity. Every step you take could be your last, but standing still is not an option.",
  "The choice is yours: will you fight to survive another day,or carve out your own path in this new, terrifying world? The apocalypse is here, and it’s not just about surviving—it’s about finding a reason to keep going.",
  "Welcome to your new reality. Welcome to the end of the world."
